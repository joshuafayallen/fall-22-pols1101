It seems to me that statistics is often sold as a sort
of alchemy that transmutes randomness into certainty, an “uncertainty laundering” that begins with data and concludes with success as measured by statistical significance - Andrew Gelman(2016)

The book tends to spend a bit to much time on the stats part of public opinion while not really giving you guys an intuition. If you have questions speak up.

This is a bit of an embellishment on my part but good polls rely on what is referred to random sampling Good polls employ questions that are valid meaning they are measuring what we think they are measuring and are reliable meaning they produce the same response

## Bad Polls 

- .bold[Leading Questions]: encourage the respondent to give a certain answer

- .bold[Double Barreled Questions]: Ask for opinions about more than one issue

- .bold[Social Desirability Bias]: Frames questions in a way that it makes one believe that a certain answer is not preferred

- .bold[Priming]: a previous question which influences answers to future questions

???
We find some some subset of problems in polling that lead us toward problems whether they are intentional or unintentional 

Double Barreled question 

Do you agree or disagree with this statement? ‘In a democracy, citizens have a duty to vote and a duty to always follow the law even when they think a law is unjust.’”

## Literary Digest vs. George Gallup


```{r}

```


???
Would you charecterize asking what your friends think about the president a good reperesentation of the feelings of president writ large? Probably not but that is kind of the literay digest poll did 


What is going on is that this is a form of sample selection bias 



Participants in research may differ systematically from the population of interest.  For example, participants included in an influenza vaccine trial may be healthy young adults, whereas those who are most likely to receive the intervention in practice may be elderly and have many comorbidities, and are therefore not representative


Taking an example from my causal inference class lets look at the relationhsip between niceness and attractiveness. I am just going to fake some data and then fit a line through it.

Does this relationship make any sense? No of course not. So lets look at what each of the four quadrants represent.

So what is happening is that the way we drew our sample distorts the true effect of niceness on attractiveness. We can start to think of the literary digest polls around these lines. There are lots of other kinds of examples we can draw. The hypothetical sample we are using is

How we do the stats really really matters. There is sort of malicious form of this that is embodied by a quote by Ronald Coase who once said that the data will confess to anything if you torture it enough. However, it is important for us to think about what is going on. In your cases you should think carefully about who is being sampled. How the sample is being drawn. If we apply this framework we can think of lots of real world applications. What do you think would happen if we conducted a survey asking what the public thinks of president Biden. But we only conduct the survey on instagram or we only conduct the survey via landlines.

## Statsy Stuff

- .bold[Population]: all the cases of interest in existence

- .bold[Sample]: a selected subset of the population from which data is collected for study

- .bold[Parameter]: measurements of population quantities

- .bold[Statistics]: measurements of the sample quantities are called


???
The book tries to skirt around "scary concepts like these". In public opinion we are trying to understand what the broader population of the United States feels like but it is a bit more difficult than asking each and every person what they think about the something. 


In the next few classes we will cover why that is. What is important to keep in mind that the book doesn't talk about is that it covers one very widely used paradigm very poorly. The paradigm that it uses is what is known as frequentism. In frequentism we assume that the sample is random but the world is fixed. The population parameter in frequentist statistics is essentially an unknowable thing that we are trying to figure out.  
---

---
## Statsy Stuff continued... 

-  .bold[Probability]: is the proportion of times that the outcome would occur in a very long sequence of observations


- .bold[Margin of Error]: expresses the amount of the random variation underlying a survey's results

- .bold[Confidence-Interval]: the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times. 

- .bold[Random Sampling]: With random selection, every person in the population has equal probability of being selected into the sample.

???
These concept  are deeply interconnected not only to how we conduct statistics in polling but to each other. The p-value is a threshold that we apply all the time in when doing statistics in political science, economics, sociology, psychology, epidemiology, education, and biostatistics literature. The p-value is a threshold that we often use to set a minimal standard that there is a relationship between our variables. If we reject the null hypothesis than this is a weak test that the thing we say is there is there. 


The confidence interval is just essentially a net. What ever quantity of interst we are calculating there is going to be some error in real life analysis that will make our sample quantity differ from the population quantity. The key question is whether or not that deviation is so extreme that we aren't actually capturing the population parameter. When polls report a margin of error they are just reporting a confidence interval. 

The problem with the statistics we normally used and what is widely taught is kind of encapsulated for by the confidence interval. What do you think that the plain english interpretation of the confidence interval is? 


The problem is that the confidence interval is us saying that 95% of the time we believe that our net captures the true population parameter. Confidence intervals tell us that there is a 95% probability that this range contains the true value of the population parameter

## Probability

This is pretty easy! it is just 2/5 or 0.4 or  40% and this should be true as we pick candies. So lets test this out with some simulations! This definition is not technically correct but it is useful for our purposes.

This is pretty neat! with our simple math we can show this holds in our toy problem! 


A more rigiourous definition of probability is that probability is a function that maps events to a real number obeying the axioms of probability

In the 1970s, there was a game show called “Let’s Make a Deal” and Monty Hall was the host. At some point in the game, contestants were asked to pick one of three doors. Behind one door there was a prize. The other doors had a goat behind them to show the contestant they had lost. After the contestant picked a door, before revealing whether the chosen door contained a prize, Monty Hall would open one of the two remaining doors and show the contestant there was no prize behind that door. Then he would ask “Do you want to switch doors?” What would you do?

We can use probability to show that if you stick with the original door choice, your chances of winning a prize remain 1 in 3. However, if you switch to the other door, your chances of winning double to 2 in 3!
 
Monty hall is a good demonstration that we don't always have a good intuition on the probability of things because we are using conditional probabilities and Bayes rule to plug in where our numbers go. So there is just a bit more math that goes into it

```


???
The coolest part about when you do sampling well is that we can approximate the population parameter. There are lots of sampling distributions but today we will cover the what is called the normal distribution or the Gaussian distribution. The normal distribution is defined by the mean and standard deviation. The mean sets the center of the distribution and the standard deviation sets the width.

```


???
If you have taken basic stats you know that the spread of the distribution can be described like this 

Importantly, central limit theorem, itself a foundation of a lot of classical statistical testing, states that sampling distributions are effectively normal as well. I’ll belabor this one next

This puppy is sort of what holds this whole thing together

What is cool about the central limit theorum is that if we keep retaking random samples of the larger population through random sampling the sample means will not only be normally distributed but we would converge to the population mean and the random sampling error would equal the standard error of the sample means. Even this one! This is just a therometer rating where people either really like trump in 2018 or really do not like him. This likely hold true for Biden as well but I didn't want to pull and clean the latest ANES data

We are going to do this by just making up some data, setting the sample mean equal to 40 and a standard deviation of 40. Than we are going to run this a million times! Each sample size is only 10 observations which generally will invite trouble if you only do it once. Put since we are doing it a million times the central limit will kick in and help us out.

This is honestly still super cool to me.

---
## Why Should You Care

- In practice  we can't ever do this 

- Samples are very expensive

- Attitudes change often

- Sampling Error

???
Polls are insanely expensive to run and we never know the "truth" so this brings us to sampling error. The cost of doing this work is that we are bound to draw a bad sample 

of trying to infer properties of the population given a sample of it. Indeed, random sampling purposely introduces random sampling error to our estimate since there will always be differences in the sample from the population that occur just by the chance sample we obtained. This may seem bad, but statisticians and social scientists will note that random sampling error is always the lesser evil to systematic error

We conceptualize random sampling error as having two components. The first is the amount of variation in the population parameter. We can’t do anything about this. Real world data can be noisy as hell, like the thermometer ratings for divisive public officials in the United States. The second component of random sampling error is the sample size component. We can do something about this: increase the number of observations in the sample.

## Confidence Intervals in Practice

```{r}
p <- 0.45
N <- 1000
B <- 10000
inside <- replicate(B, {
  x <- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
  x_hat <- mean(x)
  se_hat <- sqrt(x_hat * (1 - x_hat) / N)
  between(p, x_hat - 1.96 * se_hat, x_hat + 1.96 * se_hat)
})

tab <- replicate(100, {
  x <- sample(c(0,1), size = N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
  x_hat <- mean(x)
  se_hat <- sqrt(x_hat * (1 - x_hat) / N)
  hit <- between(p, x_hat - 1.96 * se_hat, x_hat + 1.96 * se_hat)
  c(x_hat, x_hat - 1.96 * se_hat, x_hat + 2 * se_hat, hit)
})


tab <- data.frame(poll=1:ncol(tab), t(tab))
names(tab)<-c("poll", "estimate", "low", "high", "hit")
tab <- mutate(tab, p_inside = ifelse(hit, "Yes", "No") )

ggplot(tab, aes(poll, estimate, ymin=low, ymax=high, color = p_inside)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(alpha = 0.7) + 
  coord_flip() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = p) +
  labs(title = "Look at how often our confidence intervals\n capture what we say it captures", 
       caption = "The line in this case denotes the mean") +
  theme_allen_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#e76254", "#1e466e")) +
  guides(color = guide_legend("0.45 Inside The Net"))

```


???
We not only care about the likelihood that something happens but we also care about the uncertainty around the event. This is something our simple definition of probability does not handle well. Lets say we randomly assign an increase in medicare coverage(something that actually happened). We are interested in the likelihood that we see an update in use of insurance, how many people increase the use, but we also care about the other outcomes of the expansion and the uncertainty around those numbers 

Even when we are conducting polls in the best way possible our net is not going to capture what we say it captures from time to time. Or even if we say that it is .45 due to things out of control the quantity in our sample will be slightly off

       title = "Ten Sample Means of Varying\n Sample Sizes from a Population",
       subtitle = "The diminishing returns of increasing sample size emerge around 1,000 observations.")
```



???
With this in mind, what is an ideal sample size in a situation like this (and likely other cases in a social scientific application) where there is high variation in the population and infinity trials—or even multiple trials—are not possible? In the case of the Population data we simulated above, let’s get 10 sample means from samples of varying sizes: 10, 25, 100, 400, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 10000 from this population of 250,000 observations. The following code will both execute that code and chart the 10 different sample means for each different sample size noted on the x-axis.

## What Does that Buy us?


- We calculate what are known as standard errors by $$SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

- This affects our confidence intervals because this is the formula $$CI = \bar{x}\pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

???
If you remember back to the first few slides we talked about confidence intervals/Margins of error. We know that a lot of the time that we can't always capture the population parameter but a lot of the time our net will one way to sure that net is tighter is to increase our sample. Our standard deviations are calculated by taking the sqrt of our sample size. our confidence interval than is just adding or subtracting a critical value typically 1.96. Notice that N appears in the denominator. This will shrink our confidence intervals! As we divide a small number by a super big number than we get a small number 

standard error formula annotated 

lower case sigma = sample standard deviation

n = number of observation 


CI annotation 


x bar is the mean 

z is the z score so in practice 1.96 


lower case sigma is standard deviation

## Rough Heuristics

- Consider possible motives of the poll organizers

- Examine how questions are worded 

- Check the target population and how it is sampled

- Assess the sample size and margin of error 

- Compare across survey houses and look at poll aggregators 

???
These are about as rough of heuristics as you can come by. As we have seen sample size doesnt neccessarily get you anywhere if the poll is junk. A junk poll with huge sample sizes will naturally have tighter margins of error, but not actually get you a good indicator of public opinion

## What is Public Opinion?

We generally think of it as politically relevant opinions held by citizens that are expressed openly

--


- .bold[Attitude]: The predisposition to act on a particular issue

- .bold[Opinion]: Expression or judgement on a particular issue 

???

So what is public opinion and how do we get it? 

 .bold[Political Values]: The basic principles that people hold about government

## Political Socialization 

<gsu-blockquote-alt> 

The process through which individuals and citizens acquire their political opinions

</gsu-blockquote-alt> 


???

The process through which individuals and citizens acquire their political opinions

This is a learned effect. You ARE NOT born with a political identity!

I think an easier way through which to think of political socialization is to some extent by asking how. So if you are a democrat how did you become one. If you are a republican how did you become one. If you ask some body why they are a member of this political party or why they have this political ideology. The most likely answer they will give is that they are going to quote lots and lots of things that they believe in. In this case how is a gives us a bit more leverage on the question. We start to look at the ways in which our environment shapes us politically.

## Agents of Socialization and Types of Effects 

.bold[Primary agents] – Those agents of socialization that are closest to you. They are often the most influential in an individual’s formative years.

.bold[Secondary agents] – 	Those agents of socialization that have less intimate relations with an individual. They are often most important in an individual’s later life.

.bold[Primacy Effect]: the phenomenon of aging and growth in which the ideas that an individual learns at a young age (primacy) are more likely to stick. 

.bold[Cumulative Effect]: the phenomenon of political socialization in which an individual’s political orientation will become more firm or solidified with age. 


???

Political socialization is the process by which the central tenets of the political culture are transmitted from those immersed in it to those, such as children or immigrants who are not. 



Primary agents – think face to face interaction



Like most forms of socialization, political socialization starts when we are very young. We may first become aware of politics by watching a parent or guardian vote, or seeing a YouTube video of a politician giving a speech, or watching NFL football players kneel in protest during the national anthem

family is a critical component of this only ten % of young voters vote differently from their parents if their parents both had the same party id. 

School and other learning institutions are also critical factors in your early life for political socialization. Historically, churches have had a strong influence on the behavior and political views of congregants.


Friends and peers also have a socializing effect on citizens. Communication networks are based on trust and common interests, so when we receive information from friends and neighbors, we often readily accept it because we trust them

Research shows that students are less knowledgeable and less motivated to participate in politics when civics is taught as only one class. The most effective approach to civic education is when schools integrate civic knowledge and skills throughout the curriculum






Secondary agents – groups that people are exposed to later in life your like peers at


attittudes and poltical identity are also tightly connected with same, gender identity, ethnicity and race, and socio-economic status



Sports in some cases are another natural extension of this. Salma Mousa and some co-authors look at views of Liverpool soccer fans and real behavior 

They  find that Merseyside county (home to Liverpool F.C.) experienced a 16% drop in hate crimes, compared to a synthetic control. There is no similar effect for other types of crime. We also find that Liverpool fans halved their rates of posting anti-Muslim tweets relative to fans of other top-flight clubs.

you also see some other factors poke their heads through. There is mounting evidence that the experiences of the past affect not only the long term physical health of the community but you can see that the experience of the past affects attitudes as well. This runs the gambit of victims of interpersonal crime being more politically active, people who live in a municipality that was close to a concentration camp being more conservative, to communities in Ukraine that experienced the brunt of the great famine being more pro-Russian, wealthier Southerners joining the Confederate army, and areas that were most targeted during the transatlantic and Indian ocean slave trade being less trustful 


Primacy vs. Cumulative Effects

Primacy Effect – the phenomenon of aging and growth in which the ideas that an individual learns at a young age (primacy) are more likely to stick


Cumulative Effect – the phenomenon of political socialization in which an individual’s political orientation will become more firm or solidified with age

Bos et al 

Based on data from 1,604 children who live in four different regions across the United States, we find that children not only perceive politics to be a male-dominated space, but with age, girls increasingly see political leadership as a “man’s world.” Simultaneously, as children grow older, they internalize gendered expectations, which direct their interests toward professions that embody the gendered traits that fit with their own sex. One result of this mismatch between women and politics is that girls express lower levels of interest and ambition in politics than do boys.

## How Do We Think About Politics?

.bold[Frames of Reference] – the lens through which an individual or group thinks about things politically 

- Party Identification(PID)

- Political Ideology

- Group Orientation


???
Forming opinions and the language we use to form these we use frames of reference this helps us make sense of these complex issues and what we think about them. politically these are the big three

## Frames of Reference
### Party Identification 


.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- Loyalty or affection of an individual has for a specific political party

- This can lead to selective perception on a specific issue or topic]


???
Ideology and PIDare two DIFFERENT concepts. Do not conflate the two! We have had multiple realignments over the course of American history where these and other parties that have died out have aligned in various places across the political spectrum. 

Parties sit on the ideological spectrum.  Draw the conservative Liberal spectrum 

So how do people think about politics?
Through frames of reference which are the means by which an individual or a  group thinks about something politically 

Party identification
Loyalty or affection an individual has for a specific political party 
Ex. Republican or Democrat 

Citizens use party cues not only in deciding how to vote, but also in deciding whose statements to trust. For example, there is a sharp partisan divide in American politics today over trust in the mainstream media

Political Ideology 
A coherent set of political beliefs that an individual has over a range of issues 
Conservative-Liberal Spectrum 

Group Orientation – 
The phenomenon of viewing politics through a group lens 
This may be influenced by age, race, gender, religion, etc.

.pull-right[

Studies on public opinion show that people’s opinions are unstable and inconsistent because they lack the resources to be informed 


]
???
Broadly, if someone is an ideological thinker, their attitudes will all fall in generally the same place on the “left-right spectrum” (draw on board)- this spectrum describes attitudes- on the far left, is the most liberal someone’s attitudes may be, on the far right is the most conservative someone’s attitudes may be (*in the middle would be very moderate attitudes). For example, someone who believes in very little government spending or intrusion would be very conservative (right), while someone who believes in a lot of government programs and involvement in society would be very liberal on that issue. 

It’s not that people don’t have any means of organizing their attitudes about politics…But, very few of them are ideologically consistent with their beliefs, and even fewer think about politics using the ideological (left-right) spectrum


Political elites (those who know a lot about politics)-tend to have well-structured ideologies-their ideologies bind together their positions on different policy issues- so, for example, if they are liberal, all their issue positions will be liberal. 

Non-elites (average citizens) may rely on other methods of organizing their political attitudes. For example, some people know a lot about the few issue areas they think are important (ex. Teachers know a lot about education policies), others organize their opinions based on their affiliation with a particular religion or other group.

## Motivated Reasoning

- Biased Information Search 
  - Seeking out evidence that supports your prior position

- Biased Confirmation of Information
  - Crediting or discrediting evidence that conforms to that postion
  
  
- Identity Protection
  The tendency of individuals to ract negatively/dismiss things that would cause them anxiety or cognitive dissonance 
  
???
biased information search - which involves seeking out (or disproportionally attending to) evidence that is congruent rather than incongruent with the motivating goal

biased assimilation - which refers to the tendency to credit and discredit evidence selectively in patterns that promote rather than frustrate the goal

identity-protective cognition - which reflects the tendency of people to react dismissively to information when accepting it would cause them to experience dissonance or anxiety. 

cognitive dissonance The psychological discomfort somebody feels when trying to process contradictory feelings or thoughts

## How Does Public Opinion Constrain?

- Sets boundaries for policymakers to  act 
  - Varies across issues depending on salience of issue
