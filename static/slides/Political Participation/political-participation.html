## What is Political Participation?

.bold[Political Participation]: Any action aimed at changing or supporting the actions of political agents and officials 

.pull-left[

.hiro-red[Conventional Participation]: Common actions considered culturally acceptable political activity that communicates preferences .bold[through] established institutions


]


.pull-right[
.hiro-dark-blue[Unconventional Participation]: Political activity that takes place .bold[outside] of established institutions and challenges cultural norms

]
???
What is an example of each?  

Generally where these differ is on 

---

---
## Types of Political Participation

Participating in politics can take many forms

- Voting

- Working for campaigns

- Contributing to campaigns

- Contributing to political movements or interest groups 

- Contacting public/political officials

- Protesting

- Community work

- Serving on local boards or councils 

- Joining political organizations 

- Political conversations 


???
These are all specific acts of political participation. Which of these would be considered Conventional? Which would be Unconventional?

Beyond that, are all of these forms of participation equal, in terms of costs (time, money) and benefit (how much you get back from politicians for participating in these activities (ie. listen to your concerns, address policies that are important to you)?

In other words, are all people equally capable of participating in these different activities? And if not, are all these activities equal in the messages they convey to politicians?

---


---
## Types of Participation 


.pull-left[

### Conventional 

- Voting

- Volunteering

- Working on campaigns 

- Writing your Congressman

- Writing the editor of a paper

- Signing petitions



]

.pull-right[
### Unconventional 

- Protests

- Strikes

- Boycotts

- Sit-ins

- Riots

- Marches

- Political Violence 
]

???
As a political violence scholar I would remissed if I didnt add that political violence is a form of political participation. The use of violence by groups and by people is often used in the pursuit of political goals. 

---

---
## When Do People Participate?
### When They Have 

- The Resources
  - Time
  - Money
  - Skills etc.  
- Interest 
  - Policy Interest 
  - Candidate Appeal etc.

- Recruitment
  - When people are asked to get involved 
  
  
???
Skills is like pretty broad we can think of this as information, ability to get there. Just like impute any sort of defintion of things that go into voting that arent just like these things.

# Voting

## Voting

- Who votes? 

- What drives people to vote?

- What determines vote choice?

???
Picking up on a broad theme of this class is you could take a graduate class just on voting and then dedicate an entire academic career to that. Today will be a tour de force of this and will largely think of it as like a neat little prediction problem. Than we are going to move onto next week where we will focus on the barriers in practice

---
## Two Types of Voting

- .bold[Prospective Voting]: voter behavior that evaluates candidates based on forecasts of their future political behavior.


- .bold[Retrospective Voting]: voter behavior that evaluates candidates based on their experience or past performance. 

  - Mediated Retrospective Evaluations
  - Simple Retrospective Evaluations


???

prospective voting: voting on the promise of the future 

Retrospective voting tends to be used more by voters, and can be used in two ways

MRE’s: Mediated through personal predispositions (PID) and experiences of the voter. But they are also mediated through other things like the information we consume 

are those evaluations that depend on some intermediary; for example, I need the media to provide me with information about the macro economy, but I can also use my SREs to make mediated judgments (e.g. I can use my experience with personal finance to make judgments about the national economy). MREs are mediated by a citizen's choice of information sources and opinion leaders.

SRE’s: : Based mainly on personal finance, war, civil rights, and similar things. These are things that voters have direct experience with, so their retrospective evaluations are unmediated by the media or anything

## Why Do We Not Vote? 

Lack of Mandatory registration

Lack of mandatory voting

Lack of proportional representation

Too many elections

It’s irrational


???
Americans have much lower turnout that citizens in many other advanced industrialized democracies. This is often though of as a surprise because Americans generally have equal or higher education levels and high levels of political efficacy, trust in government, and sense of civic duty (all things that increase turnout at the individual level).
So why don’t Americans vote as much?

Mandatory registration: Citizens in the United States are not automatically registered, they have to register themselves when they turn 18. Registration also has to be updated every time you move. Additionally, states have their own rules about registration deadlines, the information that is required to register, the information that you have to take with you to vote, who can register, etc.
Mandatory voting: Several other countries REQUIRE their citizens to vote, like Australia and Belgium where citizens are fined for not voting

Some people blame it on the lack or proportional representation. Under winner-take-all systems if you vote for the losing candidate you may feel that you wasted resources because you didn’t receive the benefit of electing your preferred candidate


The US holds A LOT of elections: Presidential, Midterm, Gubernatorial, State, Local, Special, Run-offs (Ex. Georgia)
It’s irrational: We’ll return to this concept in just a little

## Rational Voting Calculus




$$
`\begin{align}
\overbrace{R}^\text{Reward for Voting} = \underbrace{\text{P}}_{\text{Probability Vote Decides Election}} \times \overbrace{\text{B}}^{\text{Benefit Received if your Candidate Wins}} - \underbrace{\text{C}}_{\text{Cost of Voting}}(B	&gt; C)
\end{align}`
$$

???
In the 50's a guy named Anthony Downs came up with this little diddy. We assume that voters are rational actors. meaning that voters are profit maximizing individuals. They want to make sure they derive the most amount of benefit from voting. They do not want the benefit to exceed the cost of voting 


P denotes the probability that your vote will be the deciding vote. You, me and Big Downes know the likelihood of this being the case is pretty low. 

Costs are fairly intuitive: They can be a simple as the amount of time it takes to commute to the polling place, the amount of time it takes to commute to the both 

So people end up being free riders, because their individual vote will not influence the outcome of the election – therefore it is more rational for you to stay home and enjoy the benefit of other people voting, rather than vote yourself. 

Downs essentially argues that the individual is better of free-riding. The real sort of theoretical nuance that Downes and others try to figure out is this idea of why given the inherent irrationality of voting

You can use any order of precedence you want. What will end up happening is this 

 if C is any positive number the reward will always be negative 

I just choose some arbitrary small value and did it but you can just use basic math and see that no matter what the reward will be negative.

???
These articles use a really cleaver research design exploiting time zones to look at the effects on time and voting behavior 

often we think about the constraints of time based on the things that go on in our lives but the amount time in our day. They look at states that split inbetween two time zones. There dependent variable is Proportion of individuals who turn out in a given county. They find that lower time allocations decrease 


In this article, we have shown that local differences in time
allocations have significant effects on levels of turnout and
the composition of the electorate. Individuals who are exogenously
nudged one hour forward in their daily schedules
by time zone boundaries vote 1.5–3 percentage points less
than all-else-equal individuals on the other side of the cutoff

## Consumptive Model of Voting


$$
`\begin{align}
\overbrace{R}^\text{Reward for Voting} = \underbrace{\text{P}}_{\text{Probability Vote Decides Election}} \times \overbrace{\text{B}}^{\text{Benefit Received if your Candidate Wins}} - \underbrace{\text{C}}_{\text{Cost of Voting}} + \overbrace{\text{D}}^\text{Duty}
\end{align}`
$$



???
Riker and Ordeshook don't neccessarily disagree with Downes if you view voting solely through the lens of this strict rational choice lens. But we vote because of lots things and those things can be squishier than just does my paycheck increase. They introduce what is known as the d term

The D term can be a whole host of stuff like a sense of civic duty, social pressure, patriotism etc essentially D is the satisfaction that people derive from the act of voting. My kind of rough heuristic for understanding the D term is that there is inherent non-material benefit to voting. There is nothing quite like telling somebody fuck you. And in this case if you are voting against somebody it is a form of the middle finger

Whereas if we look at the model with the D term you are just adding a small positive value which will make the reward positive

## Who Votes?


&lt;img src="images/voter-turnout.jpg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



???
So before we go any further we need to talk about two distinct populations that go out and vote. 

There is the Voting Age Population (VAP) – which is all the voters who are eligible based on age (18+) to vote. This does not take into account legal or citizen status. Thanks to a variety of different amendments this is possible. Review: 

15th Amendment – made it possible for any adult male citizen to vote despite his race. 

19th Amendment – made it possible for any adult female to vote. 

23rd – DC citizens can vote/ be represented in EC 

24th – Abolished Poll Taxes 

26th Amendment - make it possible for anyone 18 and older to vote. It lowered the voting age from 21. 

Then there is the Voting Eligible Population (VEP) – which is all the voters who are eligible to vote based on voting status. This includes all individuals who are citizens, who are registered to vote, and in some states that are not convicted felons

## Who is *most likely* to vote?


&lt;img src="images/income.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???
For this portion we are going to think about what are consistent predictors of voting. 

Wealth vs. Poverty 
Those with higher economic status are most likely to go out and vote.  This is because they possess the resources and the time to be able to not only vote but to participate in political events. 

As you can see from this graph those that have higher incomes are most likely to vote. Roughly incomes that make more than $50,000 per year increase the likelihood well above 60% of those that are eligible. 

This is a strong predictor of voting behavior, and is dependent of all other factors that influence voting behavior. 

There are three key factors to determine whether an individual will vote or not. 
1. Resources 
2. Interest 
3. Motivation. 

Think of it as: People can’t (resources), won’t (don’t care/not interested) or haven’t been asked to participate (motivation)
Socioeconomic status = the combination of education, occupation, and income that can be used to gauge one’s position in society.

Men versus Women 

Women have on average a higher political participation rate then men consistently since the 1960’s, but there average voting rates are roughly the same.  This graph is from the turnout rates from the 2008 election and woman and men were almost equally represented in every age group, but in this election women were the more likely voters. 

This is a weak predictor of voting behavior. It is often a codependent factor of voting behavior. (meaning that it is only effective when taken into account with other factors).

Education level is the strongest predictor of an individuals voting behavior. The more educated a person is, the more likely they are to vote, as they have a better understanding of how the system works, how to influence the system, and why participation is important.

Race: 
African American: While African American turnout is the highest it has ever been historical in the last two elections (2008 and 2012) it still is generally well below that of the national average. 

Latino: On average, Latino citizens continue to vote at significantly lower rates that non-Latino white voters. However, in recent years, a larger number of organizations that serve immigrant and Latino communities have become involved in political participation. The Language Minority Provision of the Voting Rights Act, first introduced in 1975, aims to lower the cost of participation for Latino voters by requiring election material be provided in Spanish where appropriate.


Asian American: This diversity and polarization makes it difficult to generalize the voting patterns for the Asian American community. Specifically in certain areas of the country the voting rates are much higher. 

Religion:  Is a codependent factor of voting. We often associate voting with religion since it is so deeply tied to political identity specifically of the Republican Party, but more often then not it has little effect on voting by itself.  

Marital Status: Those that are married are far more likely (10x) to vote than those that are single or divorced

The problem with the figures I just showed you is that there these are based on self reported estimates from survey data. Using a proprietery dataset these authors find that this. Their data is super unique  

In the United States, whether a citizen votes (but not
who they vote for) is public record. Individual states publish this information. The voter file
data that we use in this manuscript has been collated by the data and analytics firm The Data
Trust LLC. Much like other large-scale voter-file vendors—like Catalist, L2, and Aristotle—
The Data Trust appends voting information from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia.
However, unlike other firms that share 1% samples of their voter files with researchers, we
have access to the entire Data Trust file, which contains just over 200 million individuals in a single year snapshot. Looking at two elections they have some super interesting stuff

It is important to note that another of their key findings is looking for so called turnout deserts 

explore the location and types of people who live in what we term a turnout desert
—a local community where comparatively few individuals around them vote. In this core part
of our analysis, we focus our attention on the electoral precinc

These results show that voter turnout is highly segregated by race, politics, and age in the
United States; minorities, young people, and democrats are much more likely to live in turnout
deserts. This finding holds if we define a turnout desert based on arbitrary thresholds or cutoffs.


For example, if we define a turnout desert as a precinct where turnout was one standard
deviation lower than the national average, Black, Hispanic, and Asian individuals are 3, 4, and
2.5 times more likely to live in a turnout desert than whites, respectively

## What factors in Influence our Vote? 



&lt;img src="images/clinton-trump.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



???
Yeah I'll admit that this is kind of an anti climatic answer but for the most part PID is a pretty good indicator. Indpendents tend to lean toward one party or another and tend to vote like their partisan couterparts 


When I talk about PID, I’m talking about a psychological attachment to one party or another. 
The stronger your PID, the more likely you are to vote, and the more likely you are to vote for one particular party. 

Just like with public opinion, people do not have the time, energy, education necessary to learn everything they need to know about candidates. Therefore, they tend to rely on PID as a shortcut.
People do this all the time, especially with state and local level offices

Party attachment tends to come from two primary sources
Socialization: Most people tend to adopt the PID of their parents
Retrospective: Voters keep a tally of the good/bad things each party has done (ex. Great Depression &amp; FDR led many voters to become Democrats)
.

## What Factors Influence our Vote

- Different issues may affect individual voters

- Nationally salient issues may significantly impact vote choice

- Major event

- Media

- Candidate

One issue that always influences vote choice:



&lt;img src="images/econ.png" width="20%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???

Different issues hold meaning for different voters
Issues that sway elections on a national level include salient issues (issues that are important to the American public)

What makes an issue salient?

Major Events (Obama and McCain and the Economic Collapse of 2008)

Media (Clinton and Benghazi)

Candidates also set the agenda (Sanders and Income Inequality; Trump and Immigration)

One issue that is always salient to American voters is the economy, but economic well being effects voting in varied ways


Sociotropic: How well you think the nation is doing economically

Pocketbook: How well are you doing personally?

People tend to blame themselves for their own financial state, so your own situation does not effect your vote that much, BUT people ten to blame the government for how well the nation as a whole is doing- so that significantly impacts vote choice (Republicans and Pres. Bush punished in 2008)


Political scientist to disagree what economy we consider the most. Does the broader health of the economy matter or is it just self interst all the way down? Comparative political scientists definitely still fight about this.

The Economy – single more important flux topic when it comes to voter decision. If the economy is good, voter support the incumbent. If economy is bad, voters (undecided) are more likely to support challenger.

## Declining Voter Turnout

- Growing Mobility of Voters

- The decline of social capital

- Declines in party attachment and external efficacy during this period
  - Watergate
  - Assassinations

???
Why would party attachment and external efficacy decline during this period?
Four Major Things Happened

Assassinations

Remember, that during this time period there was a LOT of political activity happening. There were a lot of marches and calls for a lot of social and political changes. Some of the big movements included the Civil Rights movement, the black power movement, the brown power movement, the women’s rights movement, etc. 
As a result, there were several prominent political activists and public figures that had a lot of support during this time period, and were ultimately assassinated.

Beginning with President Kennedy, who was shot Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, the Kennedy’s were America’s golden family. JFK was young, he was the first Catholic president. Jackie Kennedy was adored. They had several young children. So this assassination was particularly shocking
Only two years later, Malcolm X, who was prominent leader of the black nationalist movement, a prominent leader died on Feb. 21, 1965, shocking the nation.

Martin Luther King, Jr., the most prominent civil rights leader of the 1960s, was instrumental in the Birmingham bus boycott, pushed for the passage of the Civil Rights Act, was the youngest man, at the time, to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was assassinated April 4, 1968 in Memphis, where he was working to secure safer working conditions for the city’s sanitation workers
.
Finally, Robert F. Kennedy (JFK’s brother) was died June 5, 1968. He was prominent as a presidential candidate, his opposition to the Vietnam War, and had recently taken on urban poverty as an issue.
These assassinations shocked people who supported these men, discourage Americans (because these were enthusiastic, popular leaders, who were all killed in their prime), and created a general sense of apathy on the part of voters (why support a candidate if they are just going to be assassinated?).

The Vietnam War

This war was fought to halt the spread of communism from Northern Vietnam to Southern Vietnam. Approximately 500,000 troops were there by 1969. 
Americans were divided on this war, but had largely come to dislike the war by the late 1960s. Ultimately, there were two sides to the war, Hawks (who supported escalation of the war) and Doves (who support withdrawal from the war).

This effected party attachment and external efficacy because politicians from both political parties ran on a platform of winning the war in Vietnam, however, neither did during this period.
This alienated Doves because neither parties politicians withdrew, and alienated Hawks because neither side would escalate the war to a full on attack, meaning that territory was frequently won and lost because troops were unable to hold their positions.

Civil Rights Movement Turns Violent
Although the Civil Rights movement had been non-violent and peaceful during the late 1950s and early 1960s, following the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act aspects of the movement became increasingly violent. 

The tipping point here is when race riots began breaking out, starting in 1965 with Harlem and Watts, with more occurring in later years in Atlanta, Detroit, etc. These were in reaction to police officers and in some cases private citizens. Depressingly the congressional reports that these 

On one side of the issue were some people that thought the Civil Rights movement was moving too slow, not enough was getting done to get rid of discrimination. These people were frustrated by the riots, but still felt that politicians (both Republicans and Democrats) weren’t moving fast enough on the issue of race and discrimination.

On the other side were people that thought the Civil Rights movement was moving too fast and were frightened by riots and felt that more needed to be done to control population, and were also not satisfied with government (again both Republicans and Democrats)
So no matter how you feel about Civil Rights, your party and government was letting you down.

Watergate

The break in and resulting scandal totally obliterated trust in government
Conclusion: No matter who you were or what you thought during this time period, you were let down by your party and your government, decreasing PID and efficacy for everyone. This trend was stuck for Baby Boomers who still vote less than other generations. As a result, turnout continues to stay low because of generational replacement (Boomers outnumber New Dealers 2:1)

we have sort of discussed the voting population in way that doesnt acknowledge some of the other structural issues that impact people who do want to vote but face barriers to do so. I want to leave you with this as we move to talk about campaings and elections next week
